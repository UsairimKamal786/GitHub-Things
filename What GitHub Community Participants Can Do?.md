What GitHub Community Participants Can Do?

If you see a problem, report it. Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this GitHub Community. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. You can report a disruptive user or disruptive content to GitHub.
