**What is not Allowed in Github**

GitHub's Acceptable Use Policies, which are part of GitHub's Terms of Service, set a baseline for what is not allowed on GitHub. Since GitHub Community is on GitHub.com, these terms and restrictions apply to GitHub Community, including the following restrictions:

Anyone under the age of 13. If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on GitHub. GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your GitHub.com account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our Terms of Service for information about account termination.

Creating new account after account restriction. GitHub's Terms of Service state that "One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account." Additional free accounts created to inquire about flagged or suspended accounts in GitHub will be removed.

Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. GitHub Community is a professional space and should be treated as such.

Violation of Terms of Service. If your GitHub.com account is identified in violation of Terms of Service we will have to close your account.
